/*
Get Average

Write a program that takes an array, and prints the AVERAGE of the values in the array.
For example for an array [2, 10, 3], your program should print an average of 5. 
Again, make sure you come up with a simple base case and write instructions to solve that base case first, 
then test your instructions for other complicated cases. You can use a count function with this assignment.

            double [] array = {10, 28, 15};
            double sum = 0;
            double average = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
            {
                sum = sum + array[i];
                   
            }
            average = sum / array.Length;
            Console.WriteLine($"The average of the array is {average}");
